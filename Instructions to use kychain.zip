Now open another cmd instance and rum the following commands:
cd <path>/<to>/kychain/node1
start /b multichaind -datadir=. kychain@<your-ip-addrss>:4765 -daemon

If node1 doesn't havd connect permissions to the blockchain, follow thr instructions [here]().here node "servernminer' is the genesis node
